# Streamlining Product Categorization for E-commerce using LoRA

### Introduction

This project will implement and evaluate a LoRA-enhanced LLM to categorize products effectively, comparing it to traditional fine-tuning methods for both accuracy and resource usage.
We implementd three models i.e BERT, DistilRoberta and GPT-2 to solve our product categorisation problem.

### code files

The code folder has the ipynb and html files of the three models

### data

The cleaned_data.csv file in the data folder has the sample data of the entire dataset we used.

The final-report is the final project report.
